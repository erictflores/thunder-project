# Phaser Game Tutorial
One of the last individual projects we had to do at Dev Bootcamp was to learn a new technology, create something with it, and present it to the class.

I was a bit burnt out at this time and decided to use the Phaser framework and build a game. When that proved too ambitious, I decided to follow a tutorial instead. I added some minor front end tweaks (like making Superman's blasts level up after a certain point threshold, and changing the enemy images).

Not much of the source code is my own, but had a lot of fun learning about Phaser, brushing up my JavaScript skills, and, of course, playing the game itself.

Visit [http://mealette.herokuapp.com](try to get this on heroku?) to see the app in action. (Currently compatible on Google Chrome Browser through a desktop device).
